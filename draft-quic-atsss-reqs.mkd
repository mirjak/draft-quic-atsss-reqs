This document briefly presents the Access Traffic Steering, Switching, and Splitting (ATSSS) service being specified within the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP).

# Introduction {#intro}

The 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) has described the Access Traffic Steering, Switching, and Splitting (ATSSS) service, used to direct TCP traffic between endpoints with multiple available paths, in their Release 16 {{TS23501}}. In Release 16, ATSSS uses the IETF MPTCP protocol {{RFC6824}}.

As part of preparation for Release 17 studies, 3GPP has expressed an interest in other IETF protocols and protocol extensions that would remove some of the limits they experience with MPTCP. 

3GPP has contacted IETF through a formal liaison {{atsssliaison}}, letting the IETF know about this interest. From the liaison document: "The work on the study has not yet started in 3GPP, and there are thus no agreed conclusions. . The goal is to enable steering, switching and splitting of traffic (primarily UDP) across multiple accesses, including latency sensitive and real time traffic. Therefore 3GPP is interested to receive regular feedback on progress and prioritization on the multipath extensions to QUIC."

Because "3GPP SA kindly requests IETF to take the above information into account when discussing future work in prioritizing the multipath work for QUIC", but the complete specification of ATSSS in the relevant 3GPP architecture documents reflects the complexity of 3GPP networks, the authors of this draft worked to provide a high level overview of the parts of ATSSS that would be impacted by IETF protocol design, in terminology that is more familiar to IETF participants. 

This document is an informational Internet-Draft from individuals, and does not carry any special status within the IETF.

# Introduction to Access Traffic Steering, Switching, and Splitting (ATSSS) {#intro2atsss}

Mobile devices such as laptops, smartphones, tablets support multiple network
interfaces that may attach to different networks. Over the years, various techniques
have been proposed to support such multi-interfaced devices (e.g., {{RFC5533}},{{RFC6275}},{{RFC5213}}, or {{RFC6824}}). 

Users of these devices
have different expectations concerning the utilization of available network connectivity (and thus their different
network interfaces). For simplicity, we consider a smartphone that
is equipped with a WLAN interface and a cellular interface, but the discussion
below can be generalized to any network interface that supports IP.

Some users of these smartphones want to offload a maximum of their traffic onto the WLAN while expecting seamless handovers. For example, when
they move out of the reach of their home WLAN, they expect that the established flows (e.g., TCP connections, UDP flows)
will continue over the cellular interface without any interruption (called, session continuity). As the devices is assigned different IP addresses over
WLAN and the cellular networks, this seamless
handover requires some specific assistance from the network. The current
utilization of Multipath TCP on Apple smartphones is an example of this use
case {{IETFJ16}}.

Some users want to load balance their flows over the
different available networks, e.g., by sending a delay-sensitive flow over cellular and
a long download over the WLAN network. Several smartphones enable applications
to indicate their preferences when using available networks.
This steering policy can be managed by the smartphone, but flows need to continue
after a handover. 

Other users may want to combine the resources provided by the cellular and the WLAN networks
to improve the up and download throughput performance of individual flows. 
The GiGA LTE and GiGA 5G service deployed using Multipath TCP in South Korea in an example of this use case {{IETFJ16}}.

To support these different use cases in 5G networks, 3GPP is working on the
Access Traffic Steering, Switching and Splitting (ATSSS) service {{TS23501}}. This work is
further adopted by BBF to provide similar capabilities to residential gateways
equipped with multiple access interfaces, in the continuity of the Hybrid Access Networks {{TR-348}}.
In this document, we abstract many of the technical details of future 5G networks 
to explain the capabilities ATSSS needs, which may impact decisions about future work on IETF protocols.

# Conventions, Terminology, and Definitions

This document makes use of 3GPP specific terms defined in {{RFC6459}}, mainly the following ones: 

- Packet Data Network (PDN): is a packet-based network that
      either belongs to the operator or is external (such as
      the Internet or a corporate intranet).  The user eventually
      accesses services in one or more PDNs.  The operator's packet core
      networks are separated from packet data networks either by User Plane Functions (UPFs).

- UE (User Equipment): refers to the devices that are hosts with the
      ability to obtain Internet connectivity via a 3GPP network.

- Access Point Name (APN): is a Fully Qualified Domain Name
      (FQDN) and resolves to a set of gateways in an operator's network. Data Network Name (DNN) is the APN equivalent in 5GS. DNN is used for the selection of the UPF(s) for a PDU Session.
      
- User Plane: refers to data traffic and the required sessions for
      the data traffic.  In practice, IP is the only data traffic
      protocol used in the user plane.

# High level Overview {#overview}

The 5G Core (5GC) supports a service that provides exchange of data between a User Equipment (UE) and a data network (referred to as Packet Data Network (PDN)) identified by a Data Network Name (DNN). Such connectivity service, called PDU Connectivity Service, is supported via 'PDU Sessions' that are established upon request from the UE. The type of PDU Session can be IPv4, IPv6, IPv4v6, Ethernet or Unstructured.

It is out of the scope of this document to provide a comprehensive overview of 5G System (5GS) architecture. In particular, this document does not describe how PDU Sessions are established, and thus how IP addresses/prefixes are assigned to requesting User Equipment (UEs). 

An UE can be provided a multi-access PDU Connectivity Service. That is, an UE can exchange data with a PDN by using a "3GPP access network" and a "non-3GPP access network". Such service relies upon the ATSSS feature.


## Reference Architecture


To understand the operation of the ATSSS service, it is useful to consider the
reference environment shown in {{fig-arch}}. An UE
is attached to two different access networks (Access Net A and Access Net B).
These two networks are potentially shared with other users and the available
bandwidth varies over time. These fluctuations in bandwidth are managed by
using congestion control schemes.

One of these access networks is managed by a 5G provider according to
the 3GPP specifications. The second network is potentially managed by
a different organization. It is important to note that in this second case, there
is an IPSec tunnel between the UE and a dedicated device in the 5G network
(not shown in {{fig-arch}}). A dedicated IP address is assigned by means of IKEv2 to the UE to access the 5GC via this second network. 

The UE interacts with a distant server
through a ATSSS specific User Plane Function further referred to as "Proxy"
which supports ATSSS and is part of the 5G Core network.
The Proxy enables the UE to use a transport protocol that supports
the different access networks even if the server does not support it (i.e., is not multipath-capable
at transport layer).

The 5G control plane provides the UE and the Proxy with ATSSS rules that specify
which flows are eligible to the ATSSS service.

3GPP defines the following procedures {{TS23501}} that are applicable between "3GPP access" and "non-3GPP access" networks:
 
- Access Traffic Steering: selection of an access network for a new data flow and the transfer of the traffic of that data flow over the selected access network. 
- Access Traffic Switching: migration of all packets of an ongoing data flow from one access network to another access network while ensuring session continuity. 
- Access Traffic Splitting: split of the packets of a data flow across multiple access networks.

Techniques to provide ATSSS are classified by the 3GPP into two flavors: (1) high-layer techniques which operate above the IP layer (e.g., MPTCP), and (2) low-layer techniques which operate below the IP layer. Only high-layer steering techniques are discussed in this document.

The traffic that matches an ATSSS rule can be distributed among available access networks following one of these modes:

- “Active-Standby”: The traffic associated with the matching flow will be forwarded via a specific access (called 'active access') and switched to another access (called 'standby access') when the active access is unavailable. 
- “Smallest Delay”: The traffic associated with the matching flow will be forwarded via the access that presents the smallest Round-Trip Time (RTT). To that aim, specific measurements are conducted by the UE and a dedicated function co-located with the Proxy. 
- “Load-Balancing”: The traffic associated with the matching flow will be distributed among available access networks following a distribution ratio (e.g., 30% via a first access, 70% via a second access).
- “Priority-based”: For this mode, accesses are assigned priority levels that indicate which access to be used first. Concretely, the traffic associated with the matching flow will be steered on the access with a high priority till congestion is detected, then the overflow will be forwarded over a low priority access. 

In order to provide the above-mentioned steering modes, the ATSSS service relies upon a dedicated protocol called Performance Measurement Function (PMF) protocol. This protocol is enabled between the UE and the UPF and is meant to provide RTT measurements and reporting access availability/unavailability by the UE to the UPF. PMF is not specific to a given ATSSS version. 

Furthermore, these modes of operations were designed assuming that multipath protocols
such as MPTCP {{RFC6824}} would be used over the different paths between
the UE and the ATSSS. The implementations of these protocols include two
types of mechanisms to control the utilization of the paths: (i) a
path manager and (ii) a packet scheduler {{RFC8041}}.
The path manager decides when a
new subflow needs to be established over a path while the packet scheduler
selects the subflow over which the next packet will be sent. A more detailed
description of several packet schedulers may be found in
{{I-D.bonaventure-iccrg-schedulers}}.

The "Active-Standby" mode can be implemented using a path manager that tries to
use the active access and switches to the standby one after a certain number
of retransmissions. This mode of operation is similar to the utilization of
Multipath TCP on iOS smartphones {{RFC8041}}.

The "Smallest Delay" mode can be implemented using a path manager that
establishes a subflow over both paths and a packet scheduler that measures
their round-trip-times and prefers the one having the lowest round-trip-time.
These
path manager and scheduler are similar to the default packet
scheduler used by Multipath TCP on Linux {{RFC8041}}.
The "Load-Balancing" mode would use the same path manager with a weighted
round-robin scheduler.

The "Priority-based" mode can be implemented using a path manager that is
similar to the one used by the "Active-Standby" one, but which reacts faster
and a packet scheduler that prefers the high priority path. These
path manager and scheduler are similar to the ones used in
deployed Hybrid Access networks {{Hybrid}}.

We first describe the ATSSS as specified in Release 16 (called hereafter, ATSSS version 1) that uses
Multipath TCP {{RFC6824}} and the 0-RTT convert protocol {{I-D.ietf-tcpm-converters}}. We then discuss the data plane requirements for version 2 of the ATSSS specification that 3GPP plans for Release 17. More details about 3GPP releases can be found at: https://www.3gpp.org/specifications/Releases.

# ATSSS Version 1: Support for TCP

For ATSSS with Multipath TCP functionality, a client with two interfaces connected to two disjoint access networks (in this case, Access Net A and Access Net B), uses MPTCP to reach an MPTCP proxy over either, or both, of the access networks. This allows the client to communicate with a server which does not terminate MPTCP connections.

During the attachment of an ATSSS-capable UE to the network, the UE retrieves the MPTCP proxy information: an IP address, a port number, and the type of the MPTCP proxy. In the current release, the mandatory MPTCP proxy type is the "Transport Converter" {{I-D.ietf-tcpm-converters}}.

Also, both the MPTCP Client and MPTCP proxy are configured with ATSSS rules from the network that govern how the multiple network paths between the MPTCP Client and MPTCP Proxy are used. This relationship is shown using "." between the MPTCP Client and MPTCP Proxy.

An ATSSS-capable UE can make use of the MPTCP functionality by establishing MPTCP-assisted connections via the MPTCP proxy relying upon the Convert Protocol {{I-D.ietf-tcpm-converters}}. The UE behaves as a “Client”, while the MPTCP proxy behaves as a Transport Converter {{I-D.ietf-tcpm-converters}}. 

The ATSSS-capable UE sends packets bound to connections matching an ATSSS rule to the provisioned Transport Converter and destination port number. Concretely, the UE initiates the MPTCP connection towards the Transport Converter and indicates the IP address and port number of the Server within the connection establishment packet (i.e., in the payload of the SYN sent to the Transport Converter).  Doing so enables the Transport Converter to immediately initiate a connection towards that Server, without experiencing an extra delay. The Transport Converter waits until the receipt of the confirmation that the Server agrees to establish the connection before confirming it to the Client.

A flow example of an MPTCP-proxied connection is show in {{fig-example}}. This example assumes that the Server is not MPTCP-aware. The instructions included in the matching ATSSS rule will be followed for the management of the MPTCP connection (including the selection of the access network to establish the first subflow).

{: #fig-example title="An Example of MPTCP-proxied Connection Matching an ATSSS Rule."}

This approach provides 0-RTT (Zero Round-Trip Time) conversion service since no extra delay is induced by the Convert protocol compared to connections that are not proxied. Also, the Convert Protocol does not require any encapsulation (no tunnels, whatsoever).

If the server supports MPTCP, the Convert Protocol provides an option for clients to "opt-out". In such case, an MPTCP connection is directly established between the client and such server. Given that few servers are MPTCP capable, relying on the ATSSS service is the only option for UEs to make use of available multiple paths simultaneously.

# ATSSS Version 2: Adding Non-TCP Support 

## Motivation 

The MPTCP-based ATSSS discussed in the previous section is specific to TCP,
obviously. Therefore it does not support non-TCP traffic, such as
UDP, RTP, QUIC {{QUIC-Deployment}} or IPSec and DTLS VPN services.
As the share of these protocols grows, mainly driven by QUIC deployment, and the seamless handover is particularly useful for real-time traffic (e.g. voice or video calls), a future ATSSS would lose its impact if its scope does not extend
beyond supporting TCP only.

----- OB to be discussed, not convinced that this discussion is needed for IETF

However, UDP compared to TCP has different dimensions to be considered in
respect to the ATSSS high-layer approach.

1. UDP consists of a mix of traffic with different demands on transport
2. UDP is stateless and non-reliable

That does not allow a simple definition of a multipath transport protocol for UDP
like it was done for TCP purposes. Even if one would limit to support the QUIC,
as dominating part of the UDP share only, this raises issues by its nature of
an end-to-end encrypted protocol including its connection control signals. A
QUIC connection as defined in {{I-D.ietf-quic-transport}} cannot be intercepted
and converted like it is done in the ATSSS architecture for (MP)TCP
({{fig-mptcp-arch}}). Also a potentially upcoming Multipath QUIC
{{I-D.deconinck-quic-multipath}} cannot change this, as it inherits the
encryption features from {{I-D.ietf-quic-transport}}. A (MP)QUIC connection
initiated between UE and a service outside the ATSSS UPF evades therefore any
direct application of the ATSSS steering methods inside the (MP)QUIC connection
itself.

In consequence it is very likely that such traffic (UDP or a subset like QUIC)
has to be encapsulated in a multipath capable protocol between UE and UPF, which
meets the ATSSS demands on higher-layer steering. One of the key capabilities
which has to be provided by such a multipath capable protocol is its ability to
further ensure the transport characteristics of the piggy backed data exchanged
along the path between UE and the remote endpoint.

-------

Several proposals to carry non-TCP traffic were discussed, including
using TCP {{I-D.boucadair-mptcp-plain-mode}} or
defining multipath extensions to DCCP {{I-D.amend-tsvwg-multipath-dccp}}.
The work within 3GPP now focuses on using QUIC as the baseline for the second
version of ATSSS.

## QUIC as an ATSSS Data Plane Protocol 

This section discusses to what extent QUIC can be used to provide an ATSSS service and whether gaps are found.

Some ATSSS modes can be natively supported by the base QUIC specification. For example, the “Active-Standby” and “Smallest Delay” steering modes can be supported directly between an UE and a QUIC server without any assistance from the network other than the performance measurement information. 

Nevertheless, blindly distributing packets among existing paths may lead to complications such as:

- Aggressive use of user quota if one of the access networks is subject to volume-based quota. 

- The steering policy as currently defined in ATSSS is local to the UE and the proxy. There are no means to signal that policy to an upstream server. 

- Frequent connection migration if both access networks are used to forward data; each with a distinct source IP address.

Let's assess in more details how QUIC can be used to provide ATSSS for any kind of traffic.

A first approach is to use QUIC version 1 {{I-D.ietf-quic-transport}} with the Unreliable Datagram Extension {{I-D.ietf-quic-datagram}}.
In this case, there is one QUIC session between the UE and the ATSSS proxy function.
This QUIC session uses only one access network at a time. Thanks to the
connection migration capability of QUIC, it is possible to support the
switching and steering functions of ATSSS, but splitting cannot be supported.  

A second candidate solution is to also use QUIC version 1 with the Unreliable Datagram Extension, but with one QUIC session over each access network. By using
two QUIC sessions, it becomes possible to support steering by selecting
the session used to carry each flow. It also becomes possible
to support the switching function of ATSSS by moving flows from one QUIC
session to the other. However, supporting splitting is more challenging
since this would require transmitting data from the same flow over two
different sessions. For unreliable flows, this would be possible but
would result in some reordering among the datagrams that belong to
a split flow. For TCP connections, this would require a more complex
higher layer protocol that divides each bytestream in chunks are then
reordered at the other end of the session. Furthermore, since the bandwidth
available for each QUIC session varies as a function of the congestion experienced
over each access network, data sent over a congested session could delay the
delivery of subsequent data over the other session. Another difficulty
with the utilization of independent QUIC sessions is that when load balancers
are used to implement the ATSSS UPF, two QUIC sessions addressed to the
same ATSSS UPF will not necessarily be handled by the same server.

-- Med: I don't parse the sentence with laod-balancers implementing the ATSSS UPF. 

A third candidate solution is to leverage the ability of QUIC to support multiple
streams and the Unreliable Datagram Extension but extend it with
Multipath capabilities as described in {{I-D.deconinck-quic-multipath}}.
With these Multipath extensions, there is a single (Multipath) QUIC session
between the UE and the ATSSS. The Multipath extensions provide several
benefits to support ATSSSv2. Splitting is naturally supported. Data
sent over one access network can be retransmitted over the other if
the first becomes congested. Some measurements and simulations have
shown that Multipath QUIC provides similar performance as Multipath
TCP with combining different access networks {{MPQUIC-Conext}}.
Steering is also supported since UDP Datagrams
and TCP connections can be mapped over any access network based on the
ATSSS rules. Since splitting is supported, this choice can be revisited
if one of the access networks fails or becomes congested. Switching
is also supported with Multipath QUIC. Experience with Multipath TCP on
smartphones has shown that handovers are not a binary process. When
a smartphone performs handovers, there are frequently short periods
of time during which both networks are imperfect {{MPTester}}. During
these periods, it is important to be able to use both networks
simultaneously.
Since there is a single Multipath QUIC session between the UE and the
ATSSS UPF, load-balancers do not cause problems. 


## Handling both TCP and Non-TCP using QUIC

In ATSSSv1, each TCP connection originated by the UE corresponds to
an MPTCP connection that is terminated on the ATSSS function. ATSSSv2 may
leverage the multi-stream capability of QUIC to carry the bytestreams
of multiple TCP connections over a single QUIC session.
Consider an UE that is currently attached to
only one access network. This UE maintains one QUIC session with its
ATSSS proxy function. Every TCP connection that it creates results in the
creation of a stream on the QUIC session with the ATSSSv2 function.
The ATSSSv2 function maps each bytestream of the QUIC session onto a
TCP connection with a remote host. This is illustrated in {{fig-atssv2-tcp}}.

{: #fig-atssv2-tcp title="ATSSSv2 maps each TCP connection on a stream of the QUIC session between UE and ATSSS"}

This solution cannot be used to support other protocols than TCP. Each non-TCP
packet (e.g. UDP, plain IP) will be transported unreliably as a datagram
over the QUIC session by using the Unreliable Datagram Extension
{{I-D.ietf-quic-datagram}}. Transporting these datagrams unreliably as
in IPSec or DTLS tunnels prevents problems that arise when a reliable protocol
is used to transport packets that do not require reliable delivery or are
subject to their own congestion control scheme.

Two application layer protocols proposed to manage the mapping
between TCP connections and QUIC streams and the transmission of UDP
datagrams. The MASQUE protocol uses the HTTP/3 CONNECT method to
support TCP connections {{I-D.schinazi-masque-protocol}}
and extend it with a UDPCONNECT method to
support UDP {{I-D.schinazi-masque-connect-udp}}. A simpler protocol
providing similar features is proposed in {{I-D.piraux-quic-tunnel}}{{I-D.piraux-quic-tunnel-tcp}}.
